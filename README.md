## Progress Bar App

A simple app that essentially runs a timer and fills a progress bar as you work. When you start your work, click 'start'. When you take a break, click 'stop'. When you start again, click 'start', and it will pick up where you left off.

Inspired by progress bars in video games, specifically RPGs - when you see the work you're doing manifest in a growing progress bar toward the next level, it's more motivating. The 6 hours time was chosen due to many high-level performers citing 6 hours as the amount of good, focused work one should aim to complete each day toward their specific goal (Michael Phelps, Jerry Rice, Tom Brady, Alex Hormozi, Gary Keller, and many more).
