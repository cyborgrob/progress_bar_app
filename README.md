## Progress Bar App

A simple app that essentially runs a timer and fills a progress bar as you work. When you start your work, click 'start'. When you take a break, click 'stop'. When you start again, click 'start', and it will pick up where you left off.

Inspired by progress bars in video games, specifically RPGs - when you see the work you're doing manifest in a growing progress bar toward the next level, it's more motivating. You can set it for whatever time you'd like.
